\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the interview is to gain understanding of how nurses and surgeons are training to operate a da Vinci robot and perform Robot assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). 

\section{Method}
We performed a semi-structured interview with one of the nurses who train students and a surgeon. 
\section{Results}
One of the most important things during surgery and training is the emergency handling, however this requires extensive knowledge of the robot and tools. Another very important task is the placement of the robot arms because collisions during surgery can be very dangerous. Sometimes the surgeons adjust the arms themselves.

In general the training is for gaining basic knowledge about the robot and individual instruments.

\begin{itemize}
  \item First assisting nurse - Sterile, assists the surgeon inside the patients body.
  \item Scrubbed nurse - Sterile, prepare unpacked tools for the first assisting nurse.
  \item circling nurse - Not sterile, unpacks tools, and can go outside the sterile area.
\end{itemize}  

During training, on the first day Jane starts by talking and showing how tasks are done, students observe. On the second day students are expected to do most of the tasks themselves. At the end of the second day, Jane sabotages some of the equipment and the students have to find and fix it. Any mistakes done by the students are used for learning purpose. At the beginning of the training Jane makes most of the calls, however later the surgeon is expected to take on the leading role.
