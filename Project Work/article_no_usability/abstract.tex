The rate of evolution of surgical robotics has continuously increased since its inception. Training and experience with the robots is a key factor to successful operations but these events are expensive, as the equipment used is expensive and has a short lifetime, and time-consuming.

To explore the possibility of enabling alternative robot assisted surgery training methods, we design and test a virtual reality simulation of team training practised in certified institutes. This is done in cooperation with Minimal Invasive Education Centre and with Jane Petersson, First Nurse Assistant and Nurse specialist in Robot Surgery and Johan Poulsen, head surgeon at Aalborg University Hospital. To this end, a contextual study was conducted to ensure realism and accuracy of the procedure.

The experts were positive about the system's future, however it was considered too incomprehensive to consider implementation at this stage. More scenarios and features would be required in future implementations to allow for near full training sessions to be performed in VR.
