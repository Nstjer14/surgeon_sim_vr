\section{Results}
A system usability scale (SUS) was used to evaluate the usability of the system - gathering the subjective assessment of usability through a likert scale. The test included XX participants, with XX males and XX females. The SUS scored a general result of XX concluding that the interface was usable and understandable by the users. According to Bangor et al, if the results are higher than 7.3 the interface is concluded good whereas 8.5 and above is excellent \citep{bangor_empirical_2008}.
An expert review was conducted with Jane Petersson and Johan Poulsen at CREATE Aalborg University. The simulation proved to be useful as the students are able to work with the robot and thus becoming familiar with it. However, the robotic movements did not exactly resemble those of the real version but proved to not be a primary factor of the simulation. As stated by Jane Petersson / Johan Poulsen "XX". "The simulation is useful for situation that otherwise would endanger human life."
