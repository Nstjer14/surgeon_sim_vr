\subsection{Expert Review Results}

Jane Petersson and Johan Poulsen were both able to test the system. The interview following revealed that the system at present was satisfactory in the scenario, but was not comprehensive enough to warrant implementation with their students. They believed the interaction was good enough as it was, and that trainees didn't require additional features, however they both agreed that several features should be available to the instructors, such as scene change, interacting with procedures and progress, as well as changing the rules during play (for example by introducing emergencies). 

Jane Petersson thought that there was no need for the system to very accurately represent the actual scenario, that it was enough for it to be close. The actual docking and undocking was best trained in real life at a real system, and there was no need to try and replicate the physics in VR.

Johan Poulsen agreed that there were limitations, but that systems such as this could be a must-have for the future of RAMIS. He thought enabling training around the world would advance both international RAMIS procedures, thus improving the outcome of individual surgeries, but also the training of specific scenarios itself, as the system would work well as an introduction and addition to real-life training at a licensed facility.
