%motivation, why this project is important

%I think this should be enough background
Surgical robotics has evolved quickly since the 1980's and will continue to do so in the future\citep{taylor_medical_2008} In some areas, it has even become an essential technology \citep{sivaraman_robotics_2015}. Although robot assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is at worst as effective and at best lowers injury, complication, and death rates significantly compared to conventional surgery, errors still occur\citep{razmaria_does_2014, punnen_how_2013, sung_oncologic_2016,raza_long-term_2015}. Alemzadeh et al found that around 17.4\% of deaths during RAMIS occurred during the operation, and 7\% were due to staff mistakes. The majority of injuries were caused by device malfunction, but a not insignificant amount were due to staff errors. The statistics are shown in \autoref{tab:Alam}\citep{alemzadeh_adverse_2016}.

%small one-sentence conclusion on this? does it make sense as is?
According to Alemzadeh et al, one key area of RAMIS that may be improved is the "human-machine interfaces and surgical simulators that train surgical teams for handling technical problems". Other researchers suggest a variety of methods to reduce injury numbers, such as dry lab training, simulated emergency handling (including in virtual reality (VR)), and even a complete remodelling of operating theatres\citep{liberman_training_2011, huser_simulated_2014, ahmad_ambulatory_2016, abelson_virtual_2015}. These all suggest that more training is beneficial to reduce error rates.

%am i putting words in her mouth?
During an interview with, and observation of, Jane Petersson, First Nurse Assistant and Nurse Specialist in Robotic Surgery at Aalborg University Hospital and MinimalInvasiv UdviklingsCenter (Minimally Invasive Education Centre, MIUC), she stated that some of the most important aspects of RAMIS are routine and training, especially as part of a team. This claim is substantiated by several studies, showing clear improvements for experienced surgeons, but also a significant learning curve\citep{moorthy_human_2005,chandra_comparison_2010}.

Currently, MIUC's team training consists of two full day sessions for op to five nurses and surgeons. They teach both theory and practice of the da Vinci surgical system and RAMIS. This includes setup ("docking", calibration and insertion of tools and camera), surgery, troubleshooting, and finishing ("undocking", including removal of tools from the patient). Common troubleshooting procedures include recoverable and unrecoverable situations, CO$_2$ leaks, and emergency undocking (converting to open surgery). Important aspects of this training is communication between all the trainees, as well as routine and error handling.

%points to make:
%surgery and training = expensive
%more practice = better
We, together with Jane Petersson, believe this can be extended to team training in VR as shown by Abelson et al in conventional surgery and Huser et al simulating full surgery teams doing emergency fibrillation\citep{abelson_virtual_2015,huser_simulated_2014}. VR training has the benefits of being cost-effective compared to regular RAMIS training (which costs 6,000-8,000 DKK per person), at the cost of reduced accuracy, as well as enabling concurrent multi-user functionality in different locations. This would allow surgeons and nurses to train certain scenarios at their work or at home instead of travelling to certified institutions.

\subsection{Context Study}
System design and minimum implementation criteria were defined after a series of observations and interviews with Jane Petersson and Johan Poulsen. Active observations of robot surgery, surgeon training, and team training for were needed to assess the implementation requirements whereas semi-structured interviews with experts informing the design. 
\autoref{Fig:fieldresult} shows the most important objects during RAMIS. The top image shows a nurse preparing the robot arms by covering them in drapes to sterilize the equipment. An important aspect of this preparation is to place the arms correctly to avoid collisions during surgery. The middle image shows the ports that are inserted in the patient. The placement and rotation of these are important and are therefore trained repeatedly during the sessions. The bottom image shows the operating tools that are latched on to the robot arms and through the ports on the patient. These tools perform a wide variety of tasks depending on the type of tool such as cutting and grabbing tissue.
The interviews with Jane Petersson focused primarily on the important aspects of team training for surgical staff. These include communication between nurses, understanding roles in the operating room, and an introduction to the da Vinci surgical system. During training, the instructor will spend time with the trainees getting to know the robot and show important steps such as placement of the arms, insertion of ports and instruments, controls of the robot, and teach the different error messages. The trainees will then have to use their knowledge and communicate with each other when they are operating on a live pig later. This way they gain hands-on experience with the robot and its functionalities, according to Jane Petersson. She also mentioned that it is important that the instructor or someone with RAMIS experience is nearby as questions always arise. The communication is therefore not only trainee-to-trainee, but also largely trainee-to-instructor.
During RAMIS there are usually two nurses present, one surgeon, one surgeon assistant, and one anaesthetic nurse or doctor. The surgeon will sit at the surgeon console, controlling the arms of the robot while looking into a stereoscopic display. The sterile nurse and the surgeon assistant (sometimes first nurse assistant) assist the surgery by providing the right tools, monitoring the patient. The second nurse, called the circulating nurse or \textit{floor nurse} is not sterile and can therefore enter and exit the operating room as needed and perform tasks that would otherwise contaminate the other nurses. An overview of the operating room (OR) including the roles of each member of staff is visualized in \autoref{fig:overview}.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Figures/overview.pdf}
 \caption{An overview of the operating room from the field observations}
 \label{fig:overview}
 \end{figure}
 
The training room during team training is much smaller than the OR and space can be a problem in this context. Another benefit of virtualising team training would therefore be more space.

Observations of the team training emphasized the importance of precision. When dealing with surgery every variable is situation dependent. This means there is no universal way of e.g. placement and orientation of the ports and tools, tilt of operating table, or even manual control of the laporascopic tools. These procedures require concentration and are constantly evaluated and corrected by the nurse or surgeon performing them. Trainees are given visual feedback from screens placed in the room. These screens show the camera inside the patient. 


A lot of questions arise during training. These questions are often directed at the instructor. The instructor then gives an in-depth answer while often also visualizing it using the tools and robot. These questions come sporadically and often unpredictably and it is therefore important that an instructor is nearby to make sure the procedure continues. Team training also prepares the nurses for emergencies, specificly emergency undocking of the robot. When an emergency undocking is issued, the two assistants at the robot has to remove the arms and the ports on the patient and prepare for an open surgery, while the circulating nurse assists by calling for assistance and preparing the surgeon for open surgery. During this procedure precision and accuracy is not important, instead the time taken to perform the procedure becomes essential. 


%\subsection{Design}
%Based on our field work .... 
%We used Unreal engine to.... 
%
%Interviews, observations, artefact models and all field work leading to the design of the robot, room and tasks implemented in the current system. Remember to argue for the lack of precision in the simulator and why we implemented emergency undocking since everything else in team training is not viable. 
%Then instead we focus on the usability and make a shader that outline objects of interest, enable communication between participants, multiplayer, and in general make an exploratory project instead. We aim to answer if VR and Nurse team training is viable and what future projects should focus on when implementing in this context in VR. OUr experience is that there's a lot of talking and that's why it is necessary to have communication. There's a lot of showing and situation dependent illustrations that is not viable within our time constraints. 
%Remember to mention that we designed it all in unreal engine 4 and with the htc vive headset. 
%An idea in unrealæ was to implement IK hanldes and make the robot interactable but Unreal does not allow for this since the FABRIK affector position cannot be interacted with in real time. 

\section{Method}
Two types of tests were performed, a usability test and an expert review with Jane Petersson and Johan Poulsen, head surgeon at Aalborg University Hospital (AUH). Both tests were part of a system review. The system allowed multiple concurrent users to act in an operation environment with the intent of ultimately allowing RAMIS surgeons and nurses to train specific scenarios in VR with emphasis on communication and routine. The scenario is emergency undocking because of low precision requirement and time constraints. The test procedure is listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Participants are introduced to the system and the project
\item The usability participants are split up in different rooms
\item The participants perform the required tasks together
\item Usability test participants fill out questionnaires
\item A short exit interview is held
\end{itemize}

The VR environment allowed participants to interact with a virtual robot modelled after the da Vinci Si, see Figure XX. They were able to move the arms and fit it with tools. Additionally, they were able to interact with items such as scrubs found in the room, which was modelled after the AUH robotic operating room, as shown in \autoref{fig:overview}.


The scenario simulated was chosen based on interviews with Jane Petersson. They were tasked with performing an emergency undocking procedure and converting to open surgery. An overview of roles and tasks during emergency undocking is shown in \autoref{fig:undock_workflow}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/workflow_chart}
	\caption{Workchart showing the flow for each role regarding emergency undocking}
	\label{fig:undock_workflow}
\end{figure}

This scenario was chosen since it enables training vital procedures that can be represented in VR with fair accuracy. According to Jane Petersson, these are the most important tasks to train since they are what trainees undergoing team training at MIUC usually struggle with the most. Additionally, it would allow trainees to practice emergency procedures in a safe environment. Each participant was randomly assigned a role matching one shown in \autoref{fig:undock_workflow}, and informed of their tasks.

The participants used an HTC Vive head mounted display (HMD) and motion controllers connected to a non-dedicated server hosted on computer A. Computer C was located in a separate room from computer A and B. The specifications of these computers are shown in \autoref{tab:specs}.

\end{tabularx}
\caption{Specifications of the computers used}
\label{tab:specs}
\end{table}

Prior to the test, participants were informed of the two actions they could perform, namely grabbing (using the HTC Vive controller's trigger) and teleporting (using the touchpad on the controller). Teleporting is important in VR since there is limited space to move around in the real world, and thus participants were also cautioned not to move outside the bounds shown in the world by poles. They were also informed about the possibility of VR sickness [cite XX] and that should it happen, they were to inform the observers and disengage from the system.

During the tests, participants' video feed were displayed on the computer monitors for observation. They were able to communicate in the room and through voice over IP (VoIP). In the event of system error or when participants forgot tasks, controls, or otherwise were confused, facilitators were present to assist. 

After the test, participants were given a questionnaire. The questionnaire used in the usability test contained the System Usability Scale (SUS) and additional questions regarding age, gender, familiarity with VR, and XX. Following that, a short interview was held to ensure their experience matched the expectations of the test, primarily to ensure they understood the tasks. Participant performance was not observed.

An expert review was held after the usability test to assess the utility of the system qualitatively. This review is also done to determine if there are critical errors in the simulation. Jane Petersson and Johan Poulsen both participated in this interview after observing and trying the system themselves. The review followed a simple structure with a facilitator and an observer. The results from this review were used to determine the viability of the system in context.

%The scene used for testing is described in Section \ref{}. This scene was created to facilitate a simulated emergency undocking of the da Vinci surgical system. We used the contextual study to create the following procedure: REPEAT

%None of the participants in the usability test were trained in the medical field, which affects the validity of the results. This is an acceptable risk given that this is a usability test and not a utility focused test.
