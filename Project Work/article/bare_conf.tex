\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are

%motivation, why this project is important

%I think this should be enough background
Surgical robotics has evolved quickly since the 1980's and will continue to do so in the future [cite taylor medical 2008]. In some areas, it has even become an essential technology [cite sivaraman robotics 2015]. Although robot assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is at worst as effective and at best lowers injury, complication, and death rates significantly compared to conventional surgery, errors still occur [cite razmaria does 2014, punnen how 2013, sung oncologic 2016, raza long-term 2015]. Alemzadeh et al found that around 17.4\% of deaths during RAMIS occurred during the operation, and 7\% were due to staff mistakes. The majority of injuries were caused by device malfunction, but a not insignificant amount were due to staff errors (see Figure \ref{fig:Alam}) [cite alemzadeh adverse 2016].

%small one-sentence conclusion on this? does it make sense as is?
According to Alemzadeh et al, one key area of RAMIS that may be improved is the "human-machine interfaces and surgical simulators that train surgical teams for handling technical problems". Other researchers suggest a variety of methods to reduce injury numbers, such as dry lab training, simulated emergency handling, including in virtual reality (VR), and even a complete remodeling of operating theaters [cite liberman training 2011, huser simulated 2014, ahmad ambulatory 2016, abelson virtual 2015]. These all suggest that more training is beneficial to reduce error rates.

%am i putting words in her mouth?
During an interview with, and observation of, Jane Petersson, First Nurse Assistant and Nurse Specialist in Robotic Surgery at Aalborg University Hospital and MinimalInvasiv UdviklingsCenter (Minimally Invasive Education Centre, MIUC), she stated that some of the most important aspects of RAMIS are routine and training, especially as part of a team. This claim is substantiated by several studies [cite moorthy qualitative 2004, chandra comparison 2010], showing clear improvements for experienced surgeons, but also a significant learning curve.

%points to make:
%surgery and training = expensive
%more practice = better
We, together with Jane Petersson, believe this can be extended to team training in VR as shown by Abelson et al in conventional surgery [cite abelson again] and Huser et al simulating full surgery teams doing emergency fibrillation. VR training has the benefits of being cost-effective compared to regular RAMIS training (~10,000 DKK per person), at the cost of reduced accuracy, as well as enabling concurrent multi-user functionality in different locations. This would allow surgeons and nurses to train certain scenarios at their work or at home instead of travelling to certified institutions.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\section{Methods}
How did we solve the problem

%We want to follow Jane's training and implement a 3-4 person scenario where they have to go to open surgery.
%jane said they know most of the procedure, so train specific vital scenarios
%emergency is good to train in vr since it's not dangerous there
